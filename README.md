### Hi there 👋

- 🍀 I run Skcript (https://www.skcript.com), where we build Hellonext(https://hellonext.co) -- a customer feedback management and feature voting platform.
- 📫 I respond to emails. Like a lot.
- 🔭 I'm also pushing code to Skcript.com and Hellonext.co almost everyday. So if you see something today and is gone tomorrow, that would be me iterating.
- 🌱 My work is my happy place.
